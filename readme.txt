Manage your events and show them in a list view on your site.


== Description ==

The purpose of this plugin is to to show a list of events with date, time, description, place, etc. on your site by using a shortcode or a widget.

= Current Features =
* Admin pages to view/create/manage/modify events
* Available event data fields: event title, event start time, event location, event details
* Beginning and end dates for multiple-day events
* Wordpress's WYSIWYG editor for the event details. So you can include styled text, links, images and other media in your event list.
* A duplicate function for events
* Event navigation to view only upcoming events or past/future events filtered by year
* Event categories

The event list can be placed in any page or post on your Wordpress site. Just include the following short code where you want the calendar to appear:

‘[event-list]’

You can modify the listed events and their style with attributes. All available attributes can be found on the Event List -> About page.
There is also a widget available to view the upcoming events in a sidebar.

If you want to follow the development status have a look at the [git-repository on github](https://github.com/mibuthu/wp-event-list "wp-event-list git-repository").


== Installation ==

The easiest version of installing is to go to the admin page. There you can install new plugins in the menu Plugins -> Add new. Search for "Event List" and press "Install now".

If you want to install the plugin manually download the zip-file and extract the files into your wp-content/plugins folder.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get a calendar to show up in a Page or Post on my site? =
Insert the shortcode [event-list] in your page.

= How do I use styled text and images in the event descriptions? =
Event List uses the built-in Wordpress WYSIWYG editor. It's exactly the same process you use when creating Posts or Pages.

= Can I call the shortcode directly via php e.g. for my own template, theme or plugin? =
Yes, you can create an instance of the "SC_Event_List" class which located in "includes/sc_event-list.php" in the plugin folder and call the function show_html($atts).With $atts you can specify all the shortcode attributes you require. Another possibility would be to call the wordpress function "do_shortcode()".
